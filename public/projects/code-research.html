					Everything here has shaped my thinking about coding in some fashion.
					There is no suggested order to read any of this, but the most recent ones are first.

				<p>
					In many projects the context for decisions have disappeared long before the effects of the decision.
					I think ADR's are a great documentation format to adopt even in teams of one to help record the context of choices.

					Developers often push for radically changing working architecture by adding new tools.

					The first few paragraphs were admittedly hard to get into the groove of reading, but it picks up quickly.
					The section on testing has made me think more about integration tests over my preferred unit tests.
					The writer of this also created <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> which I am interested in.

					A relatively lengthy read on the ideals of offline and collaboration capable software.
					The writing structure walks through seven benefits of this approach with occasional deep dives into technical aspects.
					This also introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)</a>.

				<p>
					A nice easy-to-understand checklist of things that teams should be doing.
					There are a few parts that I'm not sure about such as daily builds instead of continuous integration.
					Some pieces of it are more geared to project managers such as scheduling, but all of it is adaptable.
