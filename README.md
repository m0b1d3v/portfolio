# Portfolio

Personal projects and interests.

This project focuses on using the HEC (HTML, EcmaScript, CSS) stack as an exercise in simplicity and standards.
My belief is that the explosion of front-end frameworks has masked great advancements in browser technology.
All aspects of development here except for deployment should be possible with just a browser and editor.
