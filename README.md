# Portfolio

Personal projects and interests.

This project focuses on using the HEC (HTML, EcmaScript, CSS) stack as an exercise in simplicity and standards.
My belief is that the explosion of front-end frameworks has masked great advancements in browser technology.
All aspects of development here should be possible with just a browser, an editor, and ever-present NPM magic.

## Testing

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used for end-to-end testing.
It allows me to quickly generate screenshots of all pages in multiple browsers for visual regression testing.
It also allows me to programmatically verify that content exists roughly where and how I want it.
There was no thorough analysis on choosing Playwright, but it did beat out Cypress, Protractor, and Storybook.
