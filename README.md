# Portfolio

Personal projects and interests.

This project focuses on using the HEC (HTML, EcmaScript, CSS) stack as an exercise in simplicity and standards.
My belief is that the explosion of front-end frameworks has masked great advancements in browser technology.
A self-imposed limitation here is that all aspects of development here should be possible without a JavaScript framework.
The web server, testing, and deploys unfortunately still rely on NPM tooling.

## Testing

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used for end-to-end testing.
It allows me to quickly generate screenshots of all pages in multiple browsers for visual regression testing.
It also allows me to programmatically verify that content exists roughly where and how I want it.
There was no thorough analysis on choosing Playwright, but it did beat out Cypress, Protractor, and Storybook.

If this is your first checkout make sure you do `npm run e2e-snapshots` before any e2e tests to generate comparison visuals.
The visual test `npm run e2e-visual` runs only in Firefox for speed and requires snapshots to pre-exist.
The content test via `npm run e2e-content` also only runs in Firefox but does not rely on snapshots.
Running all visual and content tests in all configured browsers can be done with `npm run e2e`.
